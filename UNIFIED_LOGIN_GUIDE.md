# Unified Login System Guide

## Overview
The MY CASH application now features a **unified login system** at `index.php` that automatically detects whether you're logging in as an **Admin/User** or an **Employee** and redirects you to the appropriate dashboard.

---

## üéØ Key Features

### Single Entry Point
- **One login page** for everyone at: `http://localhost/MY%20CASH/`
- No need to remember different URLs for admin vs employee login
- Beautiful modal-based login experience on the landing page

### Smart Detection
The system automatically:
1. Checks if the email exists in the `users` table (Admin/User)
2. If not found, checks the `employees` table (Employee)
3. Verifies the password against the correct hash
4. Sets appropriate session variables
5. Redirects to the correct dashboard

### Automatic Redirection
- **Admin/Regular User** ‚Üí `pages/dashboard.php`
- **Employee** ‚Üí `employee/dashboard.php`

---

## üöÄ How to Use

### For Admins/Users
1. Visit `http://localhost/MY%20CASH/`
2. Click the **"Sign In"** button in the hero section
3. Enter your registered email and password
4. Click **"Sign In"**
5. You'll be automatically redirected to `pages/dashboard.php`

### For Employees
1. Visit `http://localhost/MY%20CASH/`
2. Click the **"Sign In"** button in the hero section
3. Enter your employee email and password
4. Click **"Sign In"**

## üìã Technical Implementation

### Session Variables Set

**For Admin/User Login:**
```php
$_SESSION['user_id'] = $user['id'];
```

**For Employee Login:**
```php
$_SESSION['employee_id'] = $employee['id'];
$_SESSION['employee_name'] = $employee['name'];
$_SESSION['employee_email'] = $employee['email'];
$_SESSION['employee_role'] = $employee['role'];
$_SESSION['employee_user_id'] = $employee['user_id'];
$_SESSION['employee_company'] = $employee['company_name'];
```

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User submits login form at index.php
   ‚Üì
2. System queries users table by email
   ‚Üì
3. User found? 
   ‚Üí YES: Verify password ‚Üí Set user_id session ‚Üí Redirect to pages/dashboard.php
   ‚Üí NO: Continue to step 4
   ‚Üì
4. System queries employees table by email (with active status check)
   ‚Üì
5. Employee found?
   ‚Üí YES: Verify password ‚Üí Set employee sessions ‚Üí Update last_login ‚Üí Redirect to employee/dashboard.php
   ‚Üí NO: Show error "Invalid credentials or account not active"
```

### Database Queries

**Admin/User Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?
```

**Employee Query:**
```sql
SELECT e.*, u.name as company_name 
FROM employees e 
LEFT JOIN users u ON e.user_id = u.id 
WHERE e.email = ? 
  AND e.status = 'active' 
  AND e.is_active = 1
```

## üé® User Interface

### Landing Page with Modal
- Beautiful gradient hero section with company branding
- **"Sign In"** button opens a modal overlay
- Modal features:
  - Clean, centered design
  - Email and password fields
  - Error messages displayed prominently
  - Info box explaining the unified login
  - Close button (X) and ESC key support
  - Click outside to close

### Modal Features
- **Responsive design** - works on all screen sizes
- **Smooth animations** - fade in and slide up effects
- **Auto-focus** - email field gets focus when modal opens
- **Keyboard accessible** - ESC key to close
- **Error persistence** - if login fails, modal stays open with error message

---

## üîí Security Features

### Password Verification
- Uses PHP's `password_verify()` function
- Compares against bcrypt hashes stored in database
- Different hash fields for different user types:
  - Users: `password` column
  - Employees: `password_hash` column

### Active Status Checks
**For Employees:**
- `status = 'active'` - Employee must be active in the system
- `is_active = 1` - Employee must have login enabled
- Both conditions must be true for login to succeed

### Session Management
- Sessions started before any output
- Separate session variables for users vs employees
- No session variable overlap
- Automatic redirect if already logged in

### Last Login Tracking
- For employees, `last_login` timestamp is updated on successful login
- Helps track employee activity and security

---

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

### Old Login Pages Still Work
The following pages still function but are considered legacy:

**`pages/login.php`** - Admin/User login only
- Still accessible at `http://localhost/MY%20CASH/pages/login.php`
- Only checks `users` table
- Redirects to `pages/dashboard.php`

**`employee_login.php`** - Employee login only
- Still accessible at `http://localhost/MY%20CASH/employee_login.php`
- Only checks `employees` table
- Redirects to `employee/dashboard.php`

Both files have been updated with notices recommending the unified login at index.php.

## üéì Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. Always use the main page (`index.php`) for login
2. Set employee passwords using `business/setup_employee_access.php`
3. Ensure employees have `is_active = 1` before they can login
4. Monitor `last_login` timestamps for security

### For Employees
1. Use the main page (`index.php`) for login
2. Contact your admin if password not set
3. Ensure your status is 'active'
4. Use the same email registered in the system

### For Developers
1. Always check the correct session variable:
   - Admin pages: `$_SESSION['user_id']`
   - Employee pages: `$_SESSION['employee_id']`
2. Don't mix session variables
3. Use prepared statements for all queries
4. Hash passwords with `password_hash()` before storing
5. Verify with `password_verify()` during login
