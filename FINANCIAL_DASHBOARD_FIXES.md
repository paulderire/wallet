# Financial Dashboard Fixes - Summary

## Issue
The large stat cards in the financial dashboard weren't displaying correct data because:
1. Database queries were using wrong column names (`e.name` instead of `CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name)`)
2. Navigation links were unclear ("View Alerts" button going nowhere useful)
3. No dedicated page to view detailed employee sales records

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Page: `business/employee_sales.php`
**Purpose:** Detailed view of all employee sales transactions with filtering

**Features:**
- **Filters:**
  - Date filter (select specific date or view all)
  - Employee filter (filter by specific employee)
  - Payment method filter (cash, mobile money, bank transfer, credit)
  - Apply and reset buttons
  
- **Summary Statistics:**
  - Total Sales (sum of all transactions)
  - Cash Collected
  - Mobile Money
  - Transaction Count

- **Sales Table:**
  - Date & Time of each transaction
  - Employee name and role
  - Customer name
  - Items sold
  - Payment method (color-coded badges)
  - Amount (highlighted in green)
  - Showing up to 100 most recent records

- **Design:**
  - Purple gradient header matching dashboard theme
  - Responsive grid layout
  - Color-coded payment badges
  - Hover effects on table rows
  - Empty state with friendly message

**Access:** `http://localhost/MY%20CASH/business/employee_sales.php`

### 2. Fixed Database Column Names

**Problem:** Queries were using `e.name` which doesn't exist in employees table

**Solution:** Changed all queries to use:
```sql
CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name) as name
-- or
CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name) as employee_name
```

**Files Fixed:**
- `business/financial_dashboard.php`
  - Employee balances query (line ~28-42)
  - Inventory alerts query (line ~55-73)
  - Also fixed GROUP BY to include both first_name and last_name
  
- `business/employee_sales.php`
  - Main sales query
  - Employee filter dropdown query

### 3. Enhanced Navigation

**Added to Financial Dashboard:**

1. **Quick Links in Card Headers:**
   - Employee Sales card now has "View All Sales ‚Üí" link (top-right)
   - Inventory Alerts card now has "View All Alerts ‚Üí" link (top-right)

2. **Updated Quick Actions Section:**
   - **"üí∞ View Employee Sales"** button (green) - goes to employee_sales.php
   - **"‚ö†Ô∏è View All Alerts"** button (red) - goes to inventory_alerts.php
   - Reordered to put most important actions first
   - Color-coded for visual priority

**Before:**
```
[ Manage Employees ] [ All Inventory Alerts ] [ Manage Products ] [ Payroll ] [ Reports ]
```

**After:**
```
[ üí∞ View Employee Sales (green) ] [ ‚ö†Ô∏è View All Alerts (red) ]
[ Manage Employees ] [ Manage Products ] [ Payroll ] [ Reports ]
```

### 4. Existing inventory_alerts.php Already Working
- The alerts management page already exists and is functional
- Has acknowledge/resolve actions
- Has status filters
- Links properly from dashboard
