# ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED - Employee Sales & Alerts Collection

## üîß Issues Fixed

### Problem 1: Employee Sales Not Being Recorded
**Issue:** The `record_transaction.php` was trying to insert `task_time` column which doesn't exist in `employee_tasks` table.

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Removed `task_time` from INSERT query
- ‚úÖ Removed `task_time` from VALUES array
- ‚úÖ Kept only `task_date` (which exists in the table)

**File:** `employee/record_transaction.php`
**Line:** ~58-75

**Before:**
```php
INSERT INTO employee_tasks 
  (employee_id, user_id, task_date, task_time, title, ...)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ...)
```

**After:**
```php
INSERT INTO employee_tasks 
  (employee_id, user_id, task_date, title, ...)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ...)
```

### Problem 2: Inventory Alerts Not Being Recorded
**Issue:** The `report_stock.php` was also trying to insert `task_time` column which doesn't exist.

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Removed `task_time` from employee_tasks INSERT query
- ‚úÖ Removed `task_time` from VALUES array
- ‚úÖ Kept `alert_time` for inventory_alerts table (which DOES have that column)

**File:** `employee/report_stock.php`
**Line:** ~75-82

**Before:**
```php
INSERT INTO employee_tasks 
  (employee_id, user_id, task_date, task_time, title, ...)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ...)
```

**After:**
```php
INSERT INTO employee_tasks 
  (employee_id, user_id, task_date, title, ...)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ...)
```

---

### Problem 3: Products Not Showing (Bonus Fix)
**Issue:** Stationery items query wasn't filtering by `user_id`, so products might not show correctly.

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Added `user_id` filter to stationery_items query in `record_transaction.php`
- ‚úÖ Added `user_id` filter to stationery_items query in `report_stock.php`
- ‚úÖ Changed from `query()` to `prepare()` with parameter binding

**Files:** 
- `employee/record_transaction.php` (Line ~122)
- `employee/report_stock.php` (Line ~98)

**Before:**
```php
$stmt = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM stationery_items WHERE is_active = 1 ORDER BY item_name ASC");
$stationery_items = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
```

**After:**
```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM stationery_items WHERE user_id = ? AND is_active = 1 ORDER BY item_name ASC");
$stmt->execute([$user_id]);
$stationery_items = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
```
