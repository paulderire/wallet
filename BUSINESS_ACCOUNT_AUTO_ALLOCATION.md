# Business Account Auto-Allocation Implementation

## Overview
Implemented automatic allocation of all employee sales to a "Business Account" in the accounts page. Every time an employee records a sale, the amount is automatically deposited into the Business Account with full transaction tracking.

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Account Creation
- When the first sale is recorded, the system checks if "Business Account" exists
- If not found, automatically creates it with:
  - **Name**: "Business Account"
  - **Type**: "Business"
  - **Currency**: "RWF"
  - **Initial Balance**: 0

### 2. Automatic Deposit on Sale
Every time an employee records a sale through `employee/record_transaction.php`:

**Process:**
1. Sale is recorded in `employee_tasks` table
2. System finds or creates Business Account
3. Creates a `transactions` record with:
   - **Type**: deposit
   - **Amount**: Sale total amount
   - **Notes**: "Sale by [Employee Name] - Customer: [Customer] - Payment: [Method]"
4. Updates Business Account balance: `balance = balance + sale_amount`
5. Success message confirms: "Added to Business Account"

**Example Transaction Note:**
```
Sale by John Doe - Customer: Jane Smith - Payment: Mobile Money
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `employee/record_transaction.php`

**Added after successful sale recording:**
```php
// Automatically allocate sales to Business Account
try {
  // Check if Business Account exists
  $accStmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT id FROM accounts WHERE user_id = ? AND name = 'Business Account' LIMIT 1");
  $accStmt->execute([$user_id]);
  $businessAccount = $accStmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
  
  // Create if doesn't exist
  if (!$businessAccount) {
    $createAcc = $conn->prepare("INSERT INTO accounts (user_id, name, type, balance, currency) VALUES (?, 'Business Account', 'Business', 0, 'RWF')");
    $createAcc->execute([$user_id]);
    $business_account_id = $conn->lastInsertId();
  } else {
    $business_account_id = $businessAccount['id'];
  }
  
  // Add deposit transaction
  $transStmt = $conn->prepare("INSERT INTO transactions (account_id, type, amount, notes) VALUES (?, 'deposit', ?, ?)");
  $transNotes = "Sale by " . $employee_name . " - Customer: " . ($customer_name ?: 'Walk-in') . " - Payment: " . ucwords(str_replace('_', ' ', $payment_method));
  $transStmt->execute([$business_account_id, $total_amount, $transNotes]);
  
  // Update account balance
  $balStmt = $conn->prepare("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ? WHERE id = ?");
  $balStmt->execute([$total_amount, $business_account_id]);
  
} catch (Exception $e) {
  // Log error but don't stop the sale
  error_log("Business account allocation error: " . $e->getMessage());
}
```

**Success Message Updated:**
- Before: `"Transaction recorded successfully! Total: RWF 25,000 ($16.67)"`
- After: `"Transaction recorded successfully! Total: RWF 25,000 ($16.67) - Added to Business Account"`

### 2. `pages/accounts.php`

**A. Added CSS Styling:**
```css
/* Business Account Card */
.account-card.business {
  border-top: 4px solid #10b981;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(16,185,129,.12), rgba(16,185,129,.04));
  border: 2px solid rgba(16,185,129,.3);
}

/* Auto-Sync Badge */
.business-badge {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #10b981, #059669);
  color: white;
  padding: 4px 12px;
  border-radius: 16px;
  font-size: .7rem;
  font-weight: 700;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(16,185,129,.3);
}

/* Business Info Panel */
.business-info {
  background: rgba(16,185,129,.08);
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 12px;
  margin-top: 12px;
  font-size: .85rem;
}
```

**B. Added Today's Sales Statistics:**
```php
// Get today's sales stats
$today = date('Y-m-d');
$today_sales_stats = ['count' => 0, 'total' => 0];
$salesStmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT COUNT(*) as count, COALESCE(SUM(total_amount), 0) as total FROM employee_tasks WHERE user_id = ? AND task_date = ? AND transaction_type = 'sale'");
$salesStmt->execute([$user_id, $today]);
$today_sales_stats = $salesStmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
```

**C. Business Account Always First:**
- Modified ORDER BY clause to show Business Account at top:
  ```sql
  ORDER BY CASE WHEN name = 'Business Account' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END, id DESC
  ```

**D. Special Display for Business Account:**
```php
<!-- AUTO-SYNC Badge next to name -->
<span class="business-badge">AUTO-SYNC</span>

<!-- Today's Business Activity Panel -->
<div class="business-info">
  <div>📊 Today's Business Activity</div>
  <div>Sales Today: 5 transactions</div>
  <div>Revenue Today: RWF 125,000</div>
  <div>💡 All employee sales are automatically deposited here</div>
</div>
```

**E. Protected Account:**
- Business Account cannot be edited
- Business Account cannot be deleted
- Shows "Protected account" instead of Delete button
- Can still view and transfer money
