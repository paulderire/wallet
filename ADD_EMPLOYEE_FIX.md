# 🔧 Fix: Add Employee Functionality - Setup Guide

## Problem
The "Add Employee" button was not working because the `add_employee.php` file was missing.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Files Created:
1. **`business/add_employee.php`** - Complete employee creation form
2. **`db/employees_base_schema.sql`** - Base employees table schema

---

## 📋 Setup Instructions (IMPORTANT!)

### Step 1: Import Database Schemas (IN ORDER!)

You must import these SQL files **in the correct order**:

#### 1️⃣ First: Base Employees Table
```sql
-- In phpMyAdmin, select your database and run:
-- File: db/employees_base_schema.sql
```

This creates:
- ✅ `employees` table with all basic fields
- ✅ `is_admin` column in users table

#### 2️⃣ Second: Employee Portal Features (Optional)
```sql
-- If you want employee login and task tracking features:
-- File: db/employee_portal_schema.sql
```

This adds:
- ✅ `password_hash`, `email_verified`, `last_login`, `is_active` to employees table
- ✅ `employee_tasks` table for activity tracking
- ✅ `task_attachments`, `employee_notes`, `work_logs` tables
- ✅ Task categories and notifications tables
