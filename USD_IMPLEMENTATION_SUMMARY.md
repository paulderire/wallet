# USD Currency Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented USD dollar conversions throughout the entire app using the exchange rate **1 USD = 1500 RWF**. All existing RWF amounts remain unchanged, with USD equivalents displayed alongside them.

## Exchange Rate Configuration

### New File: `includes/currency.php`
Created a global currency configuration file with:
- Exchange rate constant: `USD_TO_RWF = 1500`
- Helper functions:
  - `rwf_to_usd($rwf)` - Convert RWF to USD
  - `usd_to_rwf($usd)` - Convert USD to RWF
  - `format_currency($rwf, $show_rwf, $show_usd)` - Format amount with both currencies

## Files Updated

## Exchange Rate Usage

All conversions use: **1 USD = 1500 RWF**

**Examples:**

- RWF 15,000 = $10.00
- RWF 150,000 = $100.00
- RWF 1,500,000 = $1,000.00
