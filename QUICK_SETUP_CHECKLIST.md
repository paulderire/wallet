- [ ] Import `db/add_admin_role.sql`
  - This adds `is_admin` column to users table
- [ ] Import `db/employee_portal_schema.sql`
  - This creates employee portal tables and adds password fields

### 2️⃣ Set Admin User
```sql
-- Run this query in phpMyAdmin SQL tab
UPDATE users SET is_admin = 1 WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
```

### 3️⃣ Test Admin Login

- [ ] Click **"Set Password"** for each employee
- [ ] Enter a password (min 6 characters)
- [ ] Confirm the password
- [ ] Save

### 5️⃣ Test Employee Login
- [ ] Logout from admin account
- [ ] Visit `http://localhost/MY%20CASH/`
- [ ] Click **"Sign In"** button
- [ ] Enter employee email and password
- [ ] Verify you're redirected to employee dashboard
- [ ] Check employee can add tasks, view dashboard, etc.

### 6️⃣ Test Error Handling
- [ ] Try logging in with wrong password
- [ ] Verify error message appears in modal
- [ ] Try with non-existent email
- [ ] Try with inactive employee account
- [ ] Modal should stay open with error message

### 7️⃣ Test Modal Functionality

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Invalid credentials or account not active"

**For Admin/User:**
- ✓ Check email is correct
- ✓ Check password is correct
- ✓ Verify account exists in `users` table

**For Employee:**
- ✓ Check email matches `employees` table
- ✓ Verify password was set using Setup Employee Access page
- ✓ Check `status = 'active'` in database
- ✓ Check `is_active = 1` in database
- ✓ Verify `password_hash` is not empty

### Problem: Modal doesn't open
- ✓ Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- ✓ Check browser console for errors (F12)
- ✓ Verify JavaScript is enabled
- ✓ Try different browser

### Problem: Redirected to wrong dashboard
- ✓ Clear all browser cookies
- ✓ Close all browser tabs
- ✓ Clear PHP sessions manually:
  ```php
  session_start();
  session_destroy();
  ```
- ✓ Try logging in again

### Problem: Database errors
- ✓ Ensure XAMPP MySQL is running
- ✓ Check `includes/db.php` for correct credentials
- ✓ Verify both SQL files were imported
- ✓ Check tables exist: `users`, `employees`
- ✓ Verify columns exist: `is_admin`, `password_hash`, `is_active`
