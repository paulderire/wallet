### Profit Margin (Auto-Calculated)
```
Margin % = ((Unit Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price) × 100
Example: ((1,500 - 1,000) / 1,000) × 100 = 50%
```

### Typical Markups:

## 📈 Stock Management

### Current Stock
- Actual quantity on hand
- Updates with transactions

### Minimum Stock
- Low stock alert trigger
- When current ≤ minimum → yellow warning

### Stock Level Formula:
```
Minimum Stock = (Daily Sales × Lead Time) + Safety Stock

Example:
- Daily Sales: 5 units
- Lead Time: 3 days (restock time)
- Safety Stock: 15 units (buffer)
= (5 × 3) + 15 = 30 units minimum
```
